/**

 *      Problem: Many Entities have dynamic properties as well as known properties.
 *      Known properites can be binded explicitly with all dynamic properties need
 *      to be captured also ensuring that there must not be any loss in information
 *      during deserialization / serialization process.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 *     This contract allows the deserialization mechanism to catch those dynamic properties
 *     in a Map so that deserialization mechanism will not loose any information and
 *     can be serialized back with no loss in dynamic properties information
